tip:
"箱" in Chinese: means "box" in English;

==========================================================wrong start==========================================================
1箱6*3=48(the program regard it as 16*3=48, which is not expected;)
1box6*3=3(the program regard it as 1*3=3, while not the same as above, also is not expected;)

1箱:6*3=0.5(don't know why it's wrong with this format)
1箱: 6*3=0.5(don't know why it's wrong with this format)
==========================================================wrong end==========================================================

==========================================================correct start==========================================================
1箱 6*3=18
1box 6*3=18
1box:6*3=18(as above, this version of Chinese is expected to be correct)
1box: 6*3=18(as above, this version of Chinese is expected to be correct)

==========================================================correct end==========================================================
